My first project - all made from total scratch and contains HTML CSS and vanilla JavaScript solutions.

I will keep its original structure, to give a picture about where I started.

Landing page is mainly HTML and CSS I only used JS to make the navbar circle effect smoother, and of course for the contact box to link it with Firebase Realtime Database so I get - if someone use it - all the data there directly.
About page contains more JS because of designing. A mousemove command let the tracking go on, and then I tried to make a little bit of 3D effect with the use of axis Z. 
The project page has a glass design and redirects the user here to Github if someone intrested about the code.
Furthermore my point was to let the users have a nice feeling when navigatin through the pages so I put as many links, buttons everywhere as I could.
