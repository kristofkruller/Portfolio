#vanillaScratchPortfolio

This porfolio repository gives an overview about me, all made from total scratch and contains HTML CSS and vanilla JavaScript solutions.

My first project was I started to build this up with only HTML and a very little CSS hobby-knowledge, so it took a long time to finalize it.

I will update this continuosly as optimalization, but besides I will try to keep its original structure, to give a picture about how I started. :)
